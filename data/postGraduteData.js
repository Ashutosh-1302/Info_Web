        discription:"This course contains two major part of Materials Science. The selection of materials based on their properties and the processing of the materials. Understanding the properties of different materials, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites, is fundamental. In this course students will learn how material properties influence selection for specific applications. In Materials Processing Techniques Casting, Forming, Joining, Machining, Powder Metallurgy, Additive Manufacturing processes will be explained. Another processing is Heat Treatment in which Annealing, Quenching, and Tempering will be discussed. There are various Surface Treatments like Coatings, Surface Modification along with various Quality Control and Testing like Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), Mechanical Testing etc."
